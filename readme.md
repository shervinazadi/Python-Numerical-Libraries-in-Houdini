## Utilizing Houdini for Computational Design in Architecture

In these example files, we are gearing Houdini Python nodes to work with NumPy and NetworkX for path-finding and aggregation of environmental analyses in a generative design process. There are two functions that read geometric data from Houdini and translate them into NumPy arrays and the other way around.

Authors would like to acknowledge the research funding from the Dutch grant Actieagenda, Ontwerpkracht, Ontwerp en Overheid, with the grant agreement number AUT03G registered at TU Delft, faculty of architecture and built environment, the department of urbanism.
